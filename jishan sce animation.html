            <div class="content">
                <p>Force and motion are fundamental concepts in physics. Force is a push or pull on an object that can cause it to change its velocity. Motion is the change in the position of an object over time. Newton's three laws of motion describe the relationship between a body and the forces acting upon it.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Newton's First Law:</strong> An object at rest stays at rest, and an object in motion stays in motion unless acted upon by an external force.</li>
                    <li><strong>Newton's Second Law:</strong> The acceleration of an object is directly proportional to the net force acting upon it and inversely proportional to its mass (F = ma).</li>
                    <li><strong>Newton's Third Law:</strong> For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.</li>

        <!-- Photosynthesis -->
        <div class="topic" id="photosynthesis">
            <h3>Photosynthesis</h3>
            <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3d/Photosynthesis_diagram.jpg/1920px-Photosynthesis_diagram.jpg" alt="Photosynthesis Diagram">
            <div class="content">
                <p>Photosynthesis is a process used by plants, algae, and some bacteria to convert light energy, usually from the Sun, into chemical energy that can be used to fuel the organisms' activities. This chemical energy is stored in carbohydrate molecules, such as sugars, which are synthesized from carbon dioxide and water – hence the name photosynthesis, which comes from the Greek words for "light" (phōs) and "putting together" (synthesis).</p>
                <p>Photosynthesis can be divided into two stages: the light-dependent reactions and the light-independent reactions (Calvin cycle).</p>
                <h4>Light-Dependent Reactions</h4>
                <p>These reactions take place in the thylakoid membranes of the chloroplasts where chlorophyll captures light energy. The energy is used to split water molecules (H<sub>2</sub>O), releasing oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>), and transferring electrons and protons to the energy carriers ATP and NADPH.</p>
                <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/81/Light_reactions_of_photosynthesis.jpg" alt="Light Reactions">
                <p>The equation for the light-dependent reactions is:</p>
                <pre>2H<sub>2</sub>O + 2NADP<sup>+</sup> + 3ADP + 3Pi + light → 2NADPH + 2H<sup>+</sup> + 3ATP + O<sub>2</sub></pre>

                <h4>Calvin Cycle (Light-Independent Reactions)</h4>
                <p>These reactions take place in the stroma of the chloroplasts. Here, ATP and NADPH produced in the light-dependent reactions are used to convert carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) into glucose (C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>6</sub>). This cycle does not require light directly but relies on the products of the light-dependent reactions.</p>
                <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1a/Calvin_cycle.jpg" alt="Calvin Cycle">
                <p>The overall equation for photosynthesis is:</p>
                <pre>6CO<sub>2</sub> + 6H<sub>2</sub>O + light energy → C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>6</sub> + 6O<sub>2</sub></pre>
                <p>This process is crucial for life on Earth, as it provides the primary source of energy for nearly all organisms and is the basis of the food chain.</p>

            <div class="content">
                <p>The solar system consists of the Sun and the objects that orbit it, including eight planets, their moons, and other celestial bodies like asteroids and comets. The eight planets in our solar system are:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Mercury</li>
                    <li>Venus</li>
                    <li>Earth</li>
                    <li>Mars</li>
                    <li>Jupiter</li>

                    <li>Neptune</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The Sun, a star at the center of our solar system, provides the gravitational pull that keeps these objects in orbit. Each planet has unique characteristics and orbits the Sun at different distances, resulting in varying climates and conditions.</p>

                <p>The water cycle describes the continuous movement of water on, above, and below the surface of the Earth. It involves several key processes:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Evaporation:</strong> Water from oceans, lakes, and rivers is heated by the sun and converted into vapor.</li>
                    <li><strong>Condensation:</strong> Water vapor rises into the atmosphere and cools, forming clouds.</li>
                    <li><strong>Precipitation:</strong> Water falls from the clouds as rain, snow, sleet, or hail.</li>
                    <li><strong>Collection:</strong> Water returns to oceans, lakes, and rivers, and the cycle repeats.</li>

                    <li><strong>Hypothesis:</strong> Proposing a tentative explanation or answer to the question.</li>
                    <li><strong>Experiment:</strong> Designing and conducting an experiment to test the hypothesis.</li>
                    <li><strong>Data Collection:</strong> Gathering and recording observations and measurements.</li>
                    <li><strong>Analysis:</strong> Interpreting the data to determine if it supports or refutes the hypothesis.</li>
